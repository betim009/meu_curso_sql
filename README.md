# Meu Curso SQL

This repository contains notes and exercises for learning SQL. Here I will create study scripts and queries while exploring the language.

## W3Schools SQL Tutorial

For quick reference, use the [W3Schools SQL tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/). It includes sample tables like `Customers` and `Orders` that are great for practicing SQL commands.

## Using the W3Schools Online SQL Editor

1. Open the [online editor](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp).
2. Choose an example or write your own query in the text box.
3. Click **Run SQL** to execute the command and view the results.

This repository contains SQL exercises.

## Using the W3Schools "Try SQL" editor

To quickly run the queries without a local database, open the [Try SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all) page and:

1. Open `w3schools_exercises.sql` from this repository and copy its contents.
2. Paste the SQL into the editor.
3. Execute each query and check the output.

### Limitations compared to a local DBMS

The W3Schools environment runs on a demo database and has some restrictions:

- Tables cannot be permanently created or modified.
- Only a subset of SQL commands is available.
- Data is reset whenever the page is reloaded.

For more advanced tests or your own data, run the exercises on a local engine such as SQLite, PostgreSQL or MySQL.
