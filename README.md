# meu_curso_sql

This repository contains SQL exercises.

## Using the W3Schools "Try SQL" editor

To quickly run the queries without a local database, open the [Try SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all) page and:

1. Open `w3schools_exercises.sql` from this repository and copy its contents.
2. Paste the SQL into the editor.
3. Execute each query and check the output.

### Limitations compared to a local DBMS

The W3Schools environment runs on a demo database and has some restrictions:

- Tables cannot be permanently created or modified.
- Only a subset of SQL commands is available.
- Data is reset whenever the page is reloaded.

For more advanced tests or your own data, run the exercises on a local engine such as SQLite, PostgreSQL or MySQL.
