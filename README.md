## W3Schools SQL Tutorial

For quick reference, use the [W3Schools SQL tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/). It includes sample tables like `Customers` and `Orders` that are great for practicing SQL commands.

2. Choose an example or write your own query in the text box.
3. Click **Run SQL** to execute the command and view the results.
